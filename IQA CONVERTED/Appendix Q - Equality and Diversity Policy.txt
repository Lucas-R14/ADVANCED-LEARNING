Purpose
This policy affirms Advanced Learning’s commitment to creating and maintaining an inclusive, respectful, and fair learning and working environment. It ensures that all individuals—regardless of background—have equal opportunities and are treated with dignity and respect in line with local and EU equality legislation.
Scope
This policy applies to all members of the Advanced Learning community, including students, staff, contractors, applicants, and visitors, across all activities and programmes offered. It covers behaviour on campus, online, and during any institution-related events or placements.
Our Commitment
Advanced Learning actively promotes equality of opportunity and values diversity. We do not tolerate discrimination, harassment, or victimisation on the basis of age, race, nationality, ethnic origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, religion or belief, marital or parental status, or any other characteristic protected by law.
Principles
We aim to:
Provide accessible and inclusive education and services
Recruit and support a diverse staff and student body
Make reasonable adjustments for individuals with disabilities
Foster an environment where differences are respected and celebrated
Challenge discriminatory attitudes or practices
Roles and Responsibilities
All staff and students share responsibility for upholding this policy. Senior management ensures policy implementation. Tutors and team leaders are expected to model inclusive behaviour and take prompt action against any breach. Training on equality and inclusive practice is provided to all staff.
Reporting Concerns
Anyone who experiences or witnesses discrimination, bullying, or harassment is encouraged to report it promptly to the designated staff contact or via the institution’s complaints procedure. All reports will be treated seriously, confidentially, and investigated fairly.
Monitoring and Improvement
The institution will monitor equality and diversity data (e.g., enrolment, staffing, progression) to assess effectiveness and inform actions. Feedback from students and staff will support continuous improvement.
Review
This policy is reviewed annually to reflect changes in legislation, guidance, and institutional practice.
