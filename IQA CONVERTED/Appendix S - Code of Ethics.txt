Code of Ethics
Version 1.0 | Date: March 2025
Applies to: All Students, Staff, and External Partners of Advanced Learning
1. Purpose
This Code of Ethics defines the academic, professional, and institutional values that guide the behaviour of all members of the Advanced Learning community. It promotes a culture of academic freedom, respect, responsibility, and integrity in all learning, teaching, research, and operational activities.
2. Scope
This code applies to all students, academic and administrative staff, visiting lecturers, collaborators, and any individual engaged with the institution in an academic or professional capacity.
3. Core Ethical Principles
Academic Freedom
All members have the right to explore, teach, question, and debate knowledge and ideas without fear of censorship or discrimination, provided this is done respectfully and in line with institutional values.
Integrity
Students and staff must act with honesty and fairness. Academic misconduct—including plagiarism, data fabrication, or deceptive research practices—is not tolerated.
Respect and Dignity
Harassment, bullying, discrimination, and intolerance based on race, gender, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, or any other protected characteristic are strictly prohibited. Respect for diverse perspectives is expected in all contexts.
Responsibility and Accountability
Everyone is expected to take responsibility for their actions, report misconduct, and contribute to a safe and ethical environment. Staff must maintain professional boundaries, and students must uphold responsibilities outlined in the Student Handbook.
Research and Professional Ethics
Research must be conducted ethically, with appropriate consent, data protection, and recognition of sources. All findings must be reported honestly, even if outcomes are unexpected or inconclusive.
4. Reporting Breaches
Any suspected breach of this Code should be reported confidentially to the Quality Assurance Officer or relevant line manager. Investigations will be conducted fairly and without retaliation against whistleblowers.
5. Enforcement and Consequences
Violations of this Code may result in disciplinary action in line with institutional policies on academic misconduct, staff discipline, or student conduct.
6. Review
This Code will be reviewed annually by the Academic Board to ensure it remains aligned with legal standards, MFHEA expectations, and the evolving needs of the institution.
