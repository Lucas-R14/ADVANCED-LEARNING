Appeals Policy and Procedure
Version 1.0 | Date: March 2025
Applies to: All Students, Staff, and External Partners of Advanced Learning
Purpose
This policy provides a fair, transparent process for students to appeal academic decisions that significantly impact their academic standing. It ensures that appeals are handled promptly and in line with the principles of natural justice and institutional accountability.
Scope
This policy applies to all students at Advanced Learning and covers appeals related to:
Assessment results
Module or course grades
Academic progression or awards
Decisions relating to recognition of prior learning (RPL)
It does not cover complaints about teaching quality, services, or misconduct, which are addressed under the Complaints Policy.
Grounds for Appeal
Students may appeal if they believe:
There was a procedural error or irregularity
There is new evidence not previously considered, for valid reasons
The decision was influenced by bias or conflict of interest
Disagreement with an academic judgment alone is not sufficient grounds for appeal.
Stage 1: Informal Clarification
Students are encouraged to seek clarification from their tutor or course coordinator within 5 working days of the decision. Many concerns can be resolved at this level without formal escalation.
Stage 2: Formal Appeal
If unresolved, a written appeal must be submitted to the Academic Office within 10 working days of the official notification of results. The appeal must include the studentâ€™s name, course, the decision being challenged, grounds for appeal, relevant evidence, and the desired resolution.
Stage 3: Investigation and Decision
An Appeals Panel (comprising staff not involved in the original decision) will review the case within 15 working days. The student will be informed in writing of the outcome, which may uphold, amend, or overturn the original decision.
Final Review
If the student remains dissatisfied, a final review may be requested based only on a failure to follow proper procedure. This request must be made within 5 working days of receiving the Stage 3 outcome.
Confidentiality and Records
All appeal proceedings will be treated in confidence. A record of each case will be maintained for quality assurance and audit purposes.
Review
This policy is reviewed annually by the Academic Board to ensure compliance with internal and external quality standards.
