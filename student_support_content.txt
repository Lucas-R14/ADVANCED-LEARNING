📚 Academic Information
This section provides an overview of how learning and assessment are structured at Advanced Learning. It’s designed to help you understand what to expect, how to succeed academically, and where to turn for support.
🏫 Study Modes
Advanced Learning offers a range of delivery modes to suit diverse student needs:
In-Person Learning – Face-to-face classes at our designated learning centres
Blended Learning – A combination of in-person sessions and online learning
Online Learning – Fully virtual, via our Moodle platform and video conferencing tools
Your mode of study will be confirmed on your programme of choice and noted in your learning schedule.
🎓 Learning and Teaching
Our teaching methods are student-centred and flexible, with a focus on practical application. You can expect:
Interactive sessions with experienced tutors
Self-directed learning activities and assignments
Access to digital learning materials via Moodle
Opportunities for reflection and feedback
We encourage active participation and open dialogue in all learning environments.
📝 Assessment Overview
You will be assessed using various methods tailored to your programme and MQF level, including:
Written assignments
Presentations or projects
Online activities and discussions
Practical assessments or exams (where applicable)
Assessments are designed to test your knowledge, critical thinking, and ability to apply what you’ve learned.
Note: Detailed assessment briefs will be given for each module, and rubrics will explain how marks are awarded.
📅 Submission Deadlines
All assessments must be submitted by the stated deadlines. Late submissions may be penalised unless an extension is formally approved in advance due to valid reasons.
🛠️ Moderation and Fairness
All assessments go through internal moderation to ensure fairness, consistency, and alignment with the required learning outcomes. This means that before and after marking, a second qualified staff member reviews a sample of the assessments to check for clarity, level appropriateness, and consistent grading. In some cases, an external academic expert may also review samples to provide independent verification. This process helps guarantee that all students are treated equitably and that academic standards are maintained across programmes.
📈 Feedback and Improvement
You’ll receive constructive feedback on all marked work within 10 working days of submission. Use this to understand your strengths and improve future assignments.

=== Appeals Policy and Procedure.docx ===

Appeals Policy and Procedure
Version 1.0 | Date: March 2025
Applies to: All Students, Staff, and External Partners of Advanced Learning
Purpose
This policy provides a fair, transparent process for students to appeal academic decisions that significantly impact their academic standing. It ensures that appeals are handled promptly and in line with the principles of natural justice and institutional accountability.
Scope
This policy applies to all students at Advanced Learning and covers appeals related to:
Assessment results
Module or course grades
Academic progression or awards
Decisions relating to recognition of prior learning (RPL)
It does not cover complaints about teaching quality, services, or misconduct, which are addressed under the Complaints Policy.
Grounds for Appeal
Students may appeal if they believe:
There was a procedural error or irregularity
There is new evidence not previously considered, for valid reasons
The decision was influenced by bias or conflict of interest
Disagreement with an academic judgment alone is not sufficient grounds for appeal.
Stage 1: Informal Clarification
Students are encouraged to seek clarification from their tutor or course coordinator within 5 working days of the decision. Many concerns can be resolved at this level without formal escalation.
Stage 2: Formal Appeal
If unresolved, a written appeal must be submitted to the Academic Office within 10 working days of the official notification of results. The appeal must include the student’s name, course, the decision being challenged, grounds for appeal, relevant evidence, and the desired resolution.
Stage 3: Investigation and Decision
An Appeals Panel (comprising staff not involved in the original decision) will review the case within 15 working days. The student will be informed in writing of the outcome, which may uphold, amend, or overturn the original decision.
Final Review
If the student remains dissatisfied, a final review may be requested based only on a failure to follow proper procedure. This request must be made within 5 working days of receiving the Stage 3 outcome.
Confidentiality and Records
All appeal proceedings will be treated in confidence. A record of each case will be maintained for quality assurance and audit purposes.
Review
This policy is reviewed annually by the Academic Board to ensure compliance with internal and external quality standards.
