Academic Integrity and Misconduct Policy
Version 1.0 | Date: March 2025
Applies to: All Students and Academic Staff at Advanced Learning
Purpose and Scope
This policy upholds the principles of academic integrity by setting out expectations, responsibilities, and procedures related to academic misconduct such as plagiarism, cheating, collusion, fabrication, and unethical behaviour. It applies to all students, academic staff, external examiners, and third parties involved in the academic process.
Definitions
Academic integrity refers to honest, fair, and responsible conduct in academic work. Misconduct includes plagiarism (using othersâ€™ work without credit), collusion (unauthorised collaboration), cheating (seeking unfair advantage), and fabrication (falsifying information). These actions compromise the integrity of assessments and are not tolerated.
Institutional Expectations
Students must submit original work, cite sources correctly, and adhere to academic rules. Staff must clearly communicate expectations, use detection tools where appropriate, design assessments that discourage misconduct, and report breaches confidentially and promptly.
Procedures for Handling Misconduct
Suspected misconduct is reported to the Academic Integrity Committee using the appropriate form. Investigations are initiated within 10 working days, and the student is invited to respond. Outcomes depend on severity and may include a warning, resubmission penalties, grade reduction, or suspension in extreme or repeated cases.
Plagiarism
Plagiarism includes copying without acknowledgment, paraphrasing without citation, using AI-generated work without disclosure, or submitting purchased content. Detection tools may be used, and penalties range from a warning and academic support (first minor offence) to failure or disciplinary action (repeat/serious offences).
Appeals
Students may appeal decisions under this policy within 5 working days by following the Academic Appeals Procedure.
Review
This policy is reviewed annually by the Academic Board to ensure compliance and relevance.
