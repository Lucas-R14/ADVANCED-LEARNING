📚 Academic Information
This section provides an overview of how learning and assessment are structured at Advanced Learning. It’s designed to help you understand what to expect, how to succeed academically, and where to turn for support.

🏫 Study Modes
Advanced Learning offers a range of delivery modes to suit diverse student needs:
In-Person Learning – Face-to-face classes at our designated learning centres
Blended Learning – A combination of in-person sessions and online learning
Online Learning – Fully virtual, via our Moodle platform and video conferencing tools
Your mode of study will be confirmed on your programme of choice and noted in your learning schedule.

🎓 Learning and Teaching
Our teaching methods are student-centred and flexible, with a focus on practical application. You can expect:
Interactive sessions with experienced tutors
Self-directed learning activities and assignments
Access to digital learning materials via Moodle
Opportunities for reflection and feedback
We encourage active participation and open dialogue in all learning environments.

📝 Assessment Overview
You will be assessed using various methods tailored to your programme and MQF level, including:
Written assignments
Presentations or projects
Online activities and discussions
Practical assessments or exams (where applicable)
Assessments are designed to test your knowledge, critical thinking, and ability to apply what you’ve learned.
Note: Detailed assessment briefs will be given for each module, and rubrics will explain how marks are awarded.

📅 Submission Deadlines
All assessments must be submitted by the stated deadlines. Late submissions may be penalised unless an extension is formally approved in advance due to valid reasons.

🛠️ Moderation and Fairness
All assessments go through internal moderation to ensure fairness, consistency, and alignment with the required learning outcomes. This means that before and after marking, a second qualified staff member reviews a sample of the assessments to check for clarity, level appropriateness, and consistent grading. In some cases, an external academic expert may also review samples to provide independent verification. This process helps guarantee that all students are treated equitably and that academic standards are maintained across programmes.

📈 Feedback and Improvement
You’ll receive constructive feedback on all marked work within 10 working days of submission. Use this to understand your strengths and improve future assignments.
