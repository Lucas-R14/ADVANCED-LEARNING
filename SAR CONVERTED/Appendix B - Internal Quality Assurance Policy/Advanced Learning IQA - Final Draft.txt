Standards for Internal Quality Assurance Policy for Quality Assurance
A. Organisation of the Quality Assurance System
Mission Alignment and Quality Framework: Advanced Learning is committed to delivering education that blends academic excellence with real-world application, aligned with its mission to foster innovation, leadership, and community engagement. To support this, a single, well-documented internal quality assurance (IQA) system is in place across all accredited programmes. The system undergoes systematic and regular reviews. Internal quality assurance processes are designed to be transparent, impartial, and free from bias, with all QA decisions documented to ensure consistency and accountability across both in-person and online delivery.
The IQA system is guided by principles of continuous improvement, student-centred delivery, and standards-based assessment. Policies and procedures are made available to all staff, and updates are communicated via internal briefings and dedicated QA communications.
The IQA system is benchmarked against the National Quality Assurance Framework and relevant MFHEA provider manuals, ensuring continued alignment with national and European standards for higher and further education.

Integration with Strategic and Operational Planning: Advanced Learning’s Internal Quality Assurance (IQA) system is fully integrated with the institution’s Strategic and Operational Plan. Quality assurance mechanisms actively support planning by generating evidence-based insights that inform decision-making, improvement initiatives, and resource allocation. QA procedures—such as student feedback analysis, internal verification outcomes, and performance indicators—are reviewed against the Operational Plan, which outlines defined activities, KPIs, timelines, and resource needs. Termly management meetings and IQA Committee reviews use these quality findings to assess institutional progress and refine strategic goals, ensuring alignment between daily operations and long-term educational objectives.

Link to Business Continuity Planning: To support risk preparedness and institutional resilience, Advanced Learning maintains a formal Business Continuity Plan (BCP). This plan identifies all critical academic and operational processes, assesses potential risks, and outlines clear procedures for prevention, response, and recovery. It includes continuity strategies for course delivery (including online platforms), student communications, certification processes, and IT infrastructure. The BCP is reviewed annually by the Academic Director in collaboration with the Administrative and QA teams. A copy of the current BCP is maintained on the staff portal and can be made available to regulators or stakeholders upon request.

Periodic Review of the IQA System: The IQA system is reviewed periodically (at minimum every two years) through formal audits or stakeholder consultations to ensure it remains relevant and aligned with current regulatory and institutional priorities.
Reviews are conducted by the Academic Director and the IQA Committee, who gather data from student feedback, staff surveys, and performance reports before proposing policy revisions. These are then discussed during termly management meetings and approved by the Board of Directors.

Cyclical Quality Assurance Model: Advanced Learning adopts a Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) approach to its quality assurance cycle, ensuring continuous improvement through structured planning, implementation, review, and refinement phases.

Regulatory Compliance: The Head of Institution, or designated Academic Director, ensures full compliance of the internal quality assurance system with the requirements of the Malta Further and Higher Education Authority (MFHEA). The IQA system governs the quality, transparency, and integrity of both teaching and assessment in accordance with national regulations, ensuring consistent standards across all delivery modes, including through the Moodle Learning Management System (LMS).
An internal compliance checklist is maintained to ensure that all MFHEA criteria are embedded in operational procedures and audit readiness is monitored continuously.

Objectives of the IQA Policy: The objectives of Advanced Learning’s IQA Policy are to:
Provide staff with adequate and clear information regarding internal quality assurance processes, including teaching, learning, and assessment procedures.
Ensure that QA procedures are consistently and fairly applied across all staff, departments, and programmes.
Implement student-centred teaching and assessment strategies that align with programme learning outcomes, supporting academic achievement and holistic development.
Ensure assessment integrity by maintaining consistency and transparency in assessment judgments, enabling fair, valid, and reliable outcomes.
Register students in the correct programme within agreed timelines and in line with MFHEA requirements.
Claim and issue valid certificates promptly upon course completion.
Maintain a secure, accessible audit trail tracking each student’s journey from application to certification, including assessments and QA records.
Promote a culture of reflective practice and accountability among staff through embedded QA procedures and shared responsibility for educational quality.

Student and Stakeholder Involvement: 
Mechanisms for Stakeholder Engagement: Students and external stakeholders—such as industry partners and academic advisors—are engaged in the design, implementation, and periodic review of IQA policies and programmes. Feedback is gathered through surveys, consultation meetings, and forums to ensure the QA system remains responsive to the evolving needs of learners, employers, and the wider community.
Use of Feedback for Quality Enhancement: Stakeholder feedback is collated in review reports and discussed during Academic Board meetings. Where relevant, this feedback informs updates to course content, delivery methods, and assessment tools.
Student Representation and Participation: Student representation is ensured through elected class representatives who participate in feedback forums and curriculum review cycles. These representatives contribute learner perspectives to the development and review of academic policies.
Inclusion in Governance Structures: Key stakeholders, including employers, academic advisors, and student representatives, are not only consulted but also actively included in quality governance structures such as review panels and curriculum validation boards.

Integration of Quality Assurance with Institutional Risk Management: Internal quality assurance is also linked to institutional risk management processes, with QA data feeding into the identification and mitigation of academic and operational risks. A risk register is maintained and reviewed as part of QA cycles.
B. Responsibilities with Respect to Quality Assurance
Quality Assurance Governance: Overall responsibility for IQA lies with Advanced Learning’s top academic leadership. The Internal Quality Assurance Coordinator or Committee, under the Academic Director’s direction, oversees policy implementation. This structure ensures QA is embedded at a senior level, with clear lines of accountability for maintaining and improving academic standards. Strategic oversight for quality assurance is also supported by the Board of Directors, who review institutional quality reports and ensure alignment with the broader mission and regulatory expectations. Quarterly QA coordination meetings are chaired by the Academic Director, with minutes recorded and action points tracked to ensure timely resolution of issues.

Appointment and Election of Governance Roles: Advanced Learning follows a transparent and formal process for the appointment and election of key academic and governance roles. The procedures and eligibility criteria for leadership roles—such as the Academic Director, Programme Coordinators, and QA Committee members—are outlined in the Institutional Governance Manual, which is available on the staff portal. Internal leadership roles are either:

Appointed by the Board of Directors based on qualifications, experience, and institutional needs (e.g. Academic Director); or
Elected by relevant academic or administrative staff through internal voting (e.g. staff representatives on the Academic Board or QA Committee).

Vacancies are announced via internal communications, and all appointments or election outcomes are documented and shared with staff. Term lengths, renewal conditions, and role responsibilities are defined within the same governance manual. This structure ensures accountability, fairness, and institutional transparency in decision-making.

Stakeholder Representation in Governance Bodies: Advanced Learning encourages inclusive governance by involving a range of internal and external stakeholders in academic and quality assurance processes. Where appropriate, governance structures such as the Academic Board, Programme Review Panels, and QA Committees include participation from students, staff, and external advisors. Student input is typically sought through elected class representatives or through structured feedback mechanisms. Staff participation includes both academic and administrative representatives who contribute to decision-making through formal or ad hoc involvement. The institution also seeks input from local employers, industry professionals, and academic consultants—particularly in the development or review of vocational programmes—to ensure relevance to labour market needs. Involvement may take the form of consultations, feedback requests, or participation in advisory or validation panels. This approach ensures that the institution’s quality assurance and programme development activities remain responsive to the expectations of learners, staff, and the broader professional context.

B. Financial Planning and Management
Strategic Financial Planning: The Head of Finance prepares a rolling five-year financial plan on an annual basis, guided by input from the Heads of Department and aligned with the institution’s strategic priorities. The plan is reviewed and approved by the Head of the Education Institution to ensure coherence with long-term objectives. The draft plan is submitted to the Board of Directors for feedback by Q4 each year, allowing time for review before the new financial year.

Budget Objectives: The Head of the Education Institution defines institutional budgetary objectives each year. These objectives serve as a foundation for the Head of Finance to develop detailed and responsive financial plans that meet operational and academic needs. These are documented in the institution’s Strategic Finance Memo and shared with senior management at the start of Q1.

Resource Allocation: Resource allocation is led annually by the Head of the Education Institution based on strategic goals and recommendations from Heads of Department. Each department is responsible for using its allocated budget efficiently and in line with the principles of economic and effective resource management.

Budget Preparation and Review: The Head of Finance is responsible for drafting the annual revenue budget, which is shared with Heads of Department for review prior to formal submission to the Head of the Education Institution. Once approved, budgets are disseminated promptly. In-year budget revisions must also be reviewed by the relevant departments and require final sign-off by the Head of the Institution. Feedback is collected through individual review meetings and consolidated into a final budget for approval no later than mid-December each year.

Budgetary Control: Day-to-day control of income and expenditure within approved budgets rests with designated budget holders. Each budget holder is responsible for monitoring actual performance and reporting to their respective Head of Department. Significant variances must be escalated to the Head of Finance for review and, if needed, corrective action.

Financial Reporting and Stakeholder Information: The Head of Finance provides timely financial reports to aid department-level management and oversight. Comprehensive budgetary statements are submitted to the Head of the Education Institution, and financial updates are shared with external stakeholders, including regulators and auditors, upon request. The institution also ensures full transparency with students by clearly communicating tuition fees, payment schedules, refund policies, and available financial assistance prior to enrolment. Students receive transparent tuition fee breakdowns at the point of offer, including clear guidance on refunds, payment terms, and available assistance. This information is included in the Student Handbook and programme information sheets.

Changes to Approved Budgets: No changes to approved budgets may be made without the explicit approval of the Head of Finance, following consultation with the Head of the Education Institution. Transfers of funds between budget lines are subject to the same approval process and are only permitted where justified by operational need.

Year-End Balances: Budget holders are generally not permitted to carry forward balances from one financial year to the next unless approved under a specific scheme authorised by the Head of the Education Institution.

Online and Blended Teaching Methodology: Where programmes are delivered in blended or fully online formats, the teaching, learning, and assessment approaches are adapted to maximise digital engagement and ensure constructive learning. Curriculum design reflects the particularities of digital delivery, including the use of multimedia content, interactive tools, and asynchronous activities. Learning outcomes are framed to accommodate digital formats while maintaining alignment with MQF levels. Online pedagogies encourage active and authentic learning, incorporating methods such as collaborative assignments, problem-solving tasks, peer feedback, and discussion forums to promote student-to-student and student-to-tutor interaction. Assessment in online settings uses a combination of continuous and summative strategies, with formative checkpoints embedded into the digital learning environment to monitor progress and support student success.
C. Accounting Arrangements and Audit Requirements
Financial Year and Basis of Accounting: The institution’s financial year runs from 1st January to 31st December. All financial records are maintained on a historical cost basis and are prepared in line with applicable accounting standards and local legislative requirements.

Retention of Financial Records: The Head of Finance is responsible for ensuring the secure and legally compliant retention of financial documentation for a minimum of ten years. Records include but are not limited to:
Invoices
Bank statements
Copies of receipts
Payroll records
Petty cash vouchers
Visa statements
Receipt books
Purchasing account statements
Electronic records are also securely stored and managed to ensure accessibility for audit and regulatory review.

External Audit and Financial Compliance: External auditors are appointed annually by the Head of the Education Institution, in consultation with the Board of Directors. Auditors are granted access to institutional premises, records, and any supporting documentation necessary to conduct a thorough audit. Their responsibilities include:
Reviewing the institution’s financial statements
Assessing internal control systems
Reporting audit findings and compliance status to the Board of Directors

Fraud, Corruption, and External Investigations: All staff, including senior management, are required to immediately report any suspicion of fraud, corruption, or financial irregularity to the Board of Directors. In addition, the institution may be subject to external investigations by regulatory bodies such as the MFHEA or other government entities, who hold similar access rights as external auditors.
D. Insurance and Institutional Risk Management
Advanced Learning maintains comprehensive insurance coverage appropriate to its operations, including but not limited to public liability, professional indemnity, and premises-related insurance. This ensures protection for the institution, staff, and students against unforeseen risks.

Risk management procedures are embedded in financial and operational planning. The institution regularly assesses potential risks related to finance, operations, legal compliance, and data security, and maintains mitigation strategies to minimise disruption.
E. Workforce Competence and Institutional Capacity

All academic staff must hold qualifications at least one MQF level higher than the course they deliver and have at least 2 years of teaching or industry experience. Administrative and QA personnel must have experience in education management or compliance. Senior leadership roles, including the Head of School, are held by individuals with at least an MQF Level 6 qualification and a minimum of five years of relevant professional experience. 

Staffing Review and Capacity: Staffing levels and qualifications are reviewed periodically to ensure sufficient institutional capacity and occupational competence in line with programme delivery requirements. Workforce planning is conducted annually in Q3 to anticipate needs for the coming academic year. Recruitment and training plans are derived from this review and documented in the HR Strategy.

3. Appropriate Design and Approval of Programmes

A. Programme Design and Development
Strategic and Regulatory Alignment: All programmes are designed in alignment with Advanced Learning’s mission and the Malta Qualifications Framework (MQF). Each course must meet the cognitive complexity, level of autonomy, and skill application described in the relevant MQF level descriptors. The Programme Development Team, led by the Academic Director, is responsible for confirming this alignment during proposal drafting and ensuring compliance with MFHEA's Level Descriptors and Referencing Report. This ensures that learners are provided with academically sound and professionally relevant qualifications that meet both institutional and national expectations.

Market Relevance and Contextual Analysis: Programme proposals are developed based on evidence of need derived from contextual research. This includes sector-specific market analysis, PEST (Political, Economic, Social and Technological) analysis, and where appropriate, demographic or labour market data. These inputs help ensure alignment with institutional strategy and the evolving demands of industry, society, and learners. Where applicable, findings from national skills reports or economic outlooks are referenced to inform the rationale for new programme proposals.

Learning Outcomes and Graduate Profile: Each programme includes clearly defined aims and intended learning outcomes that describe the knowledge, skills, and competences to be achieved. These outcomes guide curriculum design, assessment strategies, and teaching methods. The learning outcomes are mapped to the MQF level and are structured to ensure consistency, progression, and fitness for purpose. A graduate profile is also outlined to capture the attributes and capabilities students are expected to have upon completion.

Curriculum Coherence and Structure: The curriculum is modular and organised to ensure logical progression, with each module contributing to the overall programme outcomes. Programmes include an appropriate balance of theory and practice, as well as formative and summative assessments. Each module includes:
Defined aims and outcomes.
Assessment methods aligned with outcomes.
Credit values and contact hours.
Teaching and learning strategies.
Structured progression opportunities and articulation routes, supporting learner advancement into further study or employment.
Programme workload is calculated using the ECTS standard, where 1 ECTS credit equates to 25 hours of total learner effort. This includes contact hours, self-directed study, and assessment activities.
Elective Modules and Optional Components: Although current programmes at Advanced Learning do not include elective modules, the institution’s programme design framework allows for their inclusion in future offerings where appropriate. If a newly proposed programme is suited to an elective model, optional modules may be introduced to offer students greater flexibility and specialisation opportunities. The definitive programme document includes space to identify elective options, and such components would be designed to align with overall programme outcomes and quality standards. Electives, if introduced, would undergo the same approval, quality assurance, and periodic review processes as core modules.

Stakeholder Engagement: Programme design is informed by structured consultation with both internal and external stakeholders to ensure that proposed qualifications are relevant, coherent, and aligned with institutional and labour market needs. Internal stakeholders typically include faculty, academic staff, and currently enrolled students, whose feedback on curriculum structure, delivery feasibility, and learner support is gathered through workshops, surveys, and review meetings. External consultation may involve academic reviewers, industry professionals, alumni, and prospective employers, particularly in the case of vocational or employment-oriented programmes. These consultations help identify sector-specific skills needs and ensure that learning outcomes reflect real-world expectations. Stakeholder input is documented in a Stakeholder Input Summary Form, appended to the programme proposal and used by the Academic Board during the approval process. This formal process ensures that curriculum development remains responsive, current, and aligned with best practice in programme design.

Inclusive Delivery Modes: Programmes are designed for effective delivery across face-to-face, online, and blended formats. Each mode includes appropriate pedagogy, technology, and student support to ensure that learning outcomes are consistently achieved. For example:
Online programmes are supported through structured modules, multimedia content, and virtual interaction.
Face-to-face programmes emphasise classroom engagement, workshops, and practical application.
Blended delivery integrates both approaches to support diverse learner needs.
When face-to-face programmes are transitioned to an online or blended format, a structured review of the learning outcomes, delivery methods, and assessment strategies is undertaken to ensure suitability and pedagogical coherence. The review includes integrating appropriate online pedagogies such as interactive forums, problem-based learning, and formative quizzes to enhance engagement and monitor learner understanding. These adaptations are documented in the revised programme descriptor and reviewed during periodic quality assurance cycles.

Resource Feasibility and Delivery Readiness: Before a programme is approved, its feasibility is assessed to ensure that the required academic staff, infrastructure, learning materials, and support services are available. Any gaps identified during planning must be addressed prior to delivery. A resource plan is submitted alongside the programme proposal, confirming readiness and sustainability.
B. Programme Approval Process
Internal Approval and Governance: All new programmes or significant revisions are subject to internal review by a designated Programme Approval Committee or Academic Board. This body is responsible for evaluating the academic coherence, regulatory compliance, and strategic alignment of each proposal. The committee includes academic leadership, subject experts, and quality assurance representatives. A programme cannot proceed to delivery without formal written approval.

Programme Documentation Requirements: Each programme must be described in a definitive programme document, which includes:
Programme Title, 
MQF Level, 
Credit Value
Entry Requirements 
Graduate Profile
Programme Aims 
Intended Learning Outcomes
Modular Structure 
Assessment Methods
Teaching And Delivery Methods
Resource Plan and Staffing Requirements
Quality Assurance and Review Procedures
This document serves as the basis for delivery and reference and must be formally approved and version controlled. Each programme outlines the designated personnel responsible for: 
Course Design And Content Development, 
Technical And Media Support, and 
Teaching And Learner Support. 
These roles are documented in the Programme Specification.

Version Control and Change Management: A structured version control system is in place to manage programme updates. Changes are classified as:
Minor (e.g. reading list updates), which may be approved internally by the Academic Director
Major (e.g. outcome revisions or module additions), which require re-approval by the Academic Board and, where applicable, notification to the MFHEA
All changes are logged and dated, and students are informed of any modifications that affect their programme.

External Review and Consultation: Where appropriate, programmes are reviewed by external academic or industry experts to ensure benchmarking and relevance. External reviewers may provide feedback on curriculum quality, employability outcomes, or professional alignment. Their input is documented and considered as part of the final approval process.

Programme Benchmarking: Programme developers are encouraged to benchmark new and existing curricula against similar national and international qualifications to ensure relevance, quality, and competitiveness in both academic and industry contexts.

MFHEA Accreditation and Licensing: No programme is delivered without prior accreditation or approval from the Malta Further and Higher Education Authority (MFHEA), as required. The submission includes detailed syllabi, module descriptors, staff CVs, resource plans, and evidence of stakeholder input. The institution maintains active dialogue with MFHEA throughout the review process and responds promptly to any feedback or conditions imposed.

Periodic Review and Quality Enhancement: Each programme undergoes scheduled review, typically every two to three years. Reviews may also be triggered by:
Changes in regulation or national policy
Stakeholder or student feedback
Shifts in market demand or academic standards.
The review process examines curriculum content, student outcomes, and resource adequacy. Where changes are required, these follow the same approval procedures as new programmes, ensuring consistency and continuous improvement.

Programme Suspension and Withdrawal: Where a programme is to be suspended or withdrawn, the institution ensures clear communication with students, outlines teach-out arrangements and supports students in completing their studies or transferring to suitable alternatives. These steps are documented and approved by the Academic Board.



4. Student-Centred Learning, Teaching and Assessment

A. Learning and Teaching Methods
Active Participation and Engagement: Advanced Learning adopts a student-centred teaching approach that places learners at the heart of the educational process. Teaching methods are designed to encourage participation, enquiry, collaboration, and critical reflection. Instructors use a range of interactive strategies, including: 
Group Discussions, 
Case-Based Learning, 
Problem-Solving Activities, 
Presentations, and 
Project-Based Assignments. 

These approaches aim to develop both academic understanding and transferable skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.
Lesson planning templates require tutors to indicate how each session promotes active learning, and student participation is monitored through formative feedback and tutor observations logged each term.

Inclusive and Adaptive Teaching Practices: To address the varied learning styles and needs of students, instructors apply a broad range of teaching techniques and tools. Instructional delivery may include visual aids, audio-visual materials, hands-on demonstrations, and practical exercises. The institution uses the Moodle learning management system to support both online and on-campus learners by providing supplementary materials, recorded sessions, forums, and announcements. Moodle analytics are reviewed weekly by instructors to identify inactive students and trigger targeted follow-up support. Reasonable adjustments are made for students with learning difficulties or disabilities to ensure full inclusion and participation. These may include providing materials in alternative formats, adjusting delivery pace, or offering extended time for tasks.

Promoting Learner Autonomy and Self-Direction: Advanced Learning encourages students to become independent and reflective learners. Programmes incorporate opportunities for self-assessment, personal goal setting, and learner reflection. For example, students complete a self-reflection template after each assignment to evaluate their learning process. Independent projects, research assignments, and problem-based learning activities support this aim. Instructors guide students in monitoring their progress, setting realistic learning objectives, and developing strategies for improvement. This focus on learner autonomy strengthens student engagement, motivation, and ownership of their educational journey. The tutor role includes biweekly check-ins to support academic planning, especially for longer or project-based courses.

Observation and Feedback of Teaching Practice: The institution ensures continuous improvement in teaching through a structured observation and feedback system. This includes:
Initial informal observations conducted within the first four weeks of delivery.
At least two formal observations per academic year, scheduled and documented in advance.
Post-observation written reports and personalised feedback shared with each tutor in a one-to-one meeting.
These observations assess the degree to which teaching methods align with the student-centred philosophy and promote a culture of reflection and improvement among educators.

Learning Environment and Student Support: Advanced Learning ensures that the learning environment is supportive, inclusive, and conducive to active engagement. Class sizes are maintained at a level that allows personalised attention, and classrooms are arranged to facilitate interaction. Face-to-face facilities are equipped with interactive whiteboards, ergonomic seating, and breakout spaces for group work. Technological tools such as interactive whiteboards, online forums, and multimedia content are used to enhance learning. Online learners receive comparable support, with clearly structured Moodle pages, virtual check-ins, and access to tutors through messaging or scheduled office hours. Tutors are required to respond to student queries within 48 hours on weekdays. A Moodle helpdesk ticketing system ensures all queries are tracked and resolved in a timely manner. Academic support services are available to all students and include personal tutoring, academic mentoring, and language support. 

Student Representation and Feedback Integration: Student perspectives are actively sought and incorporated into teaching and learning improvements. Feedback from module evaluations, class forums, and surveys is reviewed by the Academic Board and course teams, and used to inform pedagogical enhancements, content updates, and staff development.

B. Assessment, Moderation, and Academic Integrity
Purpose and Integration of Assessment: Assessment is regarded as an integral part of the learning process. Each module includes:
Diagnostic assessment to identify starting levels.
Formative assessment to support progress and development.
Summative assessment to evaluate achievement of outcomes.
Assessments are designed to directly align with intended learning outcomes and support student development by offering regular, constructive feedback throughout the learning process.

Methods of Assessment: A diverse range of assessment methods is used to ensure validity and inclusiveness. These may include:
Written assignments, essays, and reports.
Oral presentations and viva voce exams
Quizzes and tests (online or in-person)
Practical exercises, demonstrations, or simulations
Group projects and peer assessments.
Reflective journals and portfolios
Assessment methods are chosen to reflect the nature of the learning outcomes and the level of the qualification, and to provide opportunities for students to demonstrate their skills in varied ways.

Fairness, Validity, and Reliability: To ensure fairness and consistency, all assessment instruments:
Are mapped to learning outcomes and MQF descriptors.
Use clearly defined rubrics and grading criteria.
Undergo internal moderation and verification, especially when multiple assessors are involved.
Moderation ensures that grading decisions are standardised, and that no student is unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged. Where applicable, assessments are double-marked and cross-checked by an internal verifier.

Moderation, Second Marking, and Quality Checks: Where feasible, assessments are developed and marked collaboratively by more than one academic staff member to enhance transparency and ensure consistency. All summative assessments undergo internal moderation, and in cases of high-stakes or borderline results, second marking is applied. Moderation includes verification of alignment with intended learning outcomes, marking consistency, and application of published rubrics. An internal moderation form is completed for each sample reviewed. The moderation sample includes a range of achievement levels and delivery modes. Final grades are not released until moderation is complete, and discrepancies are resolved collaboratively.

Transparency and Assessment Information: Students are provided with full information regarding their assessment at the start of each course or module. This includes:
Assessment types, deadlines, and weighting
Evaluation criteria and grading rubrics
Feedback formats and timelines

This may include clarifications on programme content, eligibility, fees, or support services. Requests for supplementary information—such as detailed syllabi or sample assessments—are handled with transparency and care to ensure informed decision-making.

Continuous Improvement: Feedback received from prospective students and applicants regarding the clarity or usefulness of public information is used to improve future editions of published content. This feedback loop contributes to the enhancement of student experience and public trust.


10. Ongoing Monitoring and Periodic Review of Programmes

A. Purpose and Principles
Continuous Quality Enhancement: Advanced Learning implements an evidence-based quality cycle by embedding both ongoing monitoring and formal periodic review across all accredited programmes. These processes are guided by the institution’s Internal Quality Assurance Policy and aligned with the standards set by the MFHEA. The goal is to ensure that each programme remains current, fit for purpose, and effective in delivering its intended learning outcomes.

Key Objectives of Programme Review:
Achievement of Programme Objectives – Verifying that the programme is meeting its educational aims and delivering the specified knowledge, skills, and competences.
Curriculum Relevance and Currency – Ensuring content reflects the latest subject knowledge, research, and professional practice.
Alignment with Stakeholder Needs – Reviewing responsiveness to changing student profiles, labour market demands, and external stakeholder feedback.
B. Ongoing Monitoring Mechanisms
Day-to-Day Monitoring: Teaching staff and academic coordinators monitor student engagement, attendance, assessment results, and classroom dynamics throughout delivery. Moodle logs and assessment submissions are reviewed alongside in-class indicators to identify patterns or issues.

Real-Time Interventions: Any challenges identified—such as high failure rates in a particular module or low engagement in online forums—trigger immediate action such as:
Modifying delivery pace,
Organising revision or support sessions,
Clarifying assessment rubrics or expectations.

Student Voice and Mid-Cycle Feedback: Students are encouraged to provide ongoing feedback through informal mechanisms (e.g. class discussions, tutorials) and mid-course evaluation forms. This helps instructors address concerns while the course is still in progress, strengthening the learner experience.
C. Formal Periodic Programme Review
Scheduled Reviews: Formal reviews are conducted annually or at the end of each delivery cycle (for short courses). These reviews involve a structured analysis of the programme and require submission of a Programme Review Report by the coordinator.

Scope of Review: The review considers:
Curriculum content and structure,
Teaching and learning methods,
Assessment validity and reliability,
Student performance statistics,
Student and staff feedback,
Graduate outcomes and progression data,
External Quality Assurance (EQA) reports, if available,
Resource sufficiency (e.g. staff, facilities, learning materials).

Review Committee: The Programme Review Report is submitted to the Academic Board or designated QA Committee. Where applicable, external experts or MFHEA feedback may be invited to supplement internal insights.

Online and blended learning programmes are subject to the same periodic review cycle as face-to-face programmes, with the addition of digital-specific indicators. These include Moodle analytics, student engagement data, and learner feedback specific to online delivery. Reviews examine the effectiveness of the LMS, accessibility of digital resources, and staff readiness in e-learning delivery. Findings are used to update both content and delivery practices in line with evolving digital pedagogy.
D. Stakeholder Engagement
Student Involvement: Students contribute formally through end-of-course evaluations and may participate in review panels. Their insights are considered central to evaluating the effectiveness of learning and teaching strategies.

External Input: For vocational or employment-oriented programmes, Advanced Learning engages relevant industry stakeholders to review alignment with labour market expectations. For example, representatives from logistics or business sectors may be consulted to ensure courses remain professionally relevant.
E. Improvement Planning and Implementation
Action Plans: Each review results in a documented action plan outlining areas for improvement, recommended changes, responsible persons, and implementation timelines. Actions may include:
Updating module content or readings,
Revising assessment formats,
Providing staff training,
Adding new support mechanisms for students.

Communication of Changes:
Internal – Teaching and administrative staff are informed of curriculum changes or procedural updates via team meetings or written notices.
External – Any changes affecting students (e.g. updated assessments, new modules, policy amendments) are communicated through updated syllabi, direct emails, student portals, and the institutional website.

F. Integration with Institutional Quality Assurance
Data-Informed Decision-Making: Reviews draw on data sets outlined in Section 8 (e.g. retention, success rates, and satisfaction metrics) to ensure recommendations are evidence-based.

Cyclical Quality Enhancement: Findings from programme reviews inform institutional development strategies, contributing to curriculum development, resource planning, and long-term improvement initiatives.

Audit and Accreditation Readiness: Records of all reviews and resulting actions are securely maintained and available for external audits, validations, or re-accreditation visits.



11. Recording and Maintaining Student Information

A. Purpose and Scope

Advanced Learning maintains a structured, secure, and compliant system for recording, managing, and archiving student information. This system spans the full student lifecycle, from initial application through to certification and beyond. Accurate record-keeping is essential not only for academic integrity and institutional accountability, but also for enabling long-term verification of awards. Core academic records are retained for a minimum of 40 years in line with MFHEA expectations, while other categories are managed according to defined retention schedules.

B. Categories of Student Records

Student files are created upon enrolment and regularly updated throughout the learner’s academic journey. Each official record includes the following core categories:

Admission and identity documentation, such as the application form, proof of ID, and evidence of entry qualifications.
Enrolment and registration data, including the programme name, cohort, registration date, and status updates (e.g. deferral or withdrawal).
Academic progress and assessment results, recorded in both digital and, where applicable, physical formats. These include coursework, exam results, and feedback records, all linked to learning outcomes.
Attendance and participation, tracked via registers for face-to-face sessions and LMS logs for online programmes.
Formal communication and support notes, documenting any interventions, academic advising, accommodations, or disciplinary actions.
Award and certification information, with certificate numbers, qualification titles, and issuance dates logged in the central awards register.

C. Systems and Access Controls

All records are stored securely using the institution’s Student Information Management System and Moodle LMS for online programmes. The digital infrastructure includes password protection, restricted access based on staff roles, and automatic backup procedures with off-site storage for business continuity.

Physical records (e.g. signed assessments or ID copies) are kept in locked storage accessible only to authorised personnel. Lecturers have access only to relevant academic data for their students, while sensitive personal information is restricted to designated administrative staff.

Any changes made to records (e.g. grade adjustments or corrections) are logged with a timestamp, reason, and authorisation details. This audit trail ensures transparency and accountability in student data management.

D. Retention and Disposal

Retention schedules are set according to regulatory guidance. Core academic records such as grades, enrolment data, and awards are retained for at least 40 years. Other supporting documentation, such as assessment scripts or attendance records, is retained for a minimum of five years post-course completion unless otherwise required.

At the end of their retention period, records are securely disposed of. Digital records are permanently deleted, while physical documents are destroyed using secure shredding or incineration methods to protect data privacy.

E. Student Access and Institutional Assurance

Students have the right to request access to their own records, and Advanced Learning has a documented process for issuing transcripts, certificates, or official letters upon request. Requests are handled in compliance with GDPR and national data protection laws.
