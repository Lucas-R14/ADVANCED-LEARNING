Learning Analytics Protocol
Version: 1.0

1. Purpose
This SOP formalises the institution’s use of learning analytics to enhance student engagement, identify at-risk learners, and support academic performance across all programmes. It ensures data is used ethically, transparently, and in alignment with the institution’s Data Protection Policy.
2. Scope
This protocol applies to all students, tutors, academic coordinators, and QA personnel across all modes of delivery (on-site, blended, and online). It includes data extracted from the Learning Management System (Moodle) and other integrated academic tools.
3. Definitions
Learning Analytics: The collection, analysis, and reporting of data about learners and their contexts to understand and improve learning.
At-Risk Student: A learner identified through early warning indicators (e.g., low attendance, non-submission, poor scores).
Engagement Indicator: A metric such as login frequency, time spent on platform, activity completion, or forum participation.
4. Tools and Data Sources
Moodle Activity Logs (logins, time on page, submissions)
Assessment Results (gradebook entries, trends)
Attendance Records (manual or LMS-integrated)
Feedback and Survey Responses (when relevant)
CPD Reports (for tutor engagement and performance analytics)
5. Key Responsibilities

6. Procedure Steps
a) Data Collection
Analytics are pulled weekly via Moodle reports.
Tutors are expected to input grades and attendance within 48 hours of activity.
b) Flagging At-Risk Students
Students are flagged for early support if any of the following apply:
2+ consecutive absences
Non-submission of 2 or more tasks
LMS login inactivity of more than 5 days (online learners)
Grade average below 50%
c) Intervention Process
Student Support Officer contacts flagged students within 3 working days
Support is documented in the Student Intervention Log
Interventions may include: academic counselling, referrals, deadline extensions, or accessibility accommodations
d) Reporting and Quality Assurance
Monthly analytics summaries are shared with the QA Committee
Persistent issues trigger curriculum or delivery reviews at programme level
Annual reports include cohort-wide engagement and attainment patterns
7. Data Privacy and Ethics
Students are informed at induction about the use of learning analytics.
Data is used only for academic support and institutional enhancement.
Access to student-level analytics is restricted to relevant staff.
Analytics data is retained for a maximum of 2 academic years.
8. Review and Oversight
This SOP is reviewed annually by the QA Committee and updated as necessary to reflect emerging technologies, best practice, and student feedback.
