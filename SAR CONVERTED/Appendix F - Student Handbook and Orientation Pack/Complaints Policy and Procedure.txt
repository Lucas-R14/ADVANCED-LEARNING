Complaints Policy and Procedure
Version 1.0 | Date: March 2025
Applies to: All Students and Academic Staff at Advanced Learning
Purpose and Scope
This policy outlines how Advanced Learning handles complaints to ensure concerns are addressed promptly, fairly, and transparently. It applies to all students, staff, and external stakeholders such as guest lecturers and suppliers. Covered areas include issues related to teaching, resources, behaviour, administration, or perceived unfairness. It excludes academic appeals and whistleblowing, which follow separate procedures.
Guiding Principles
Advanced Learning respects the right to complain and ensures all complaints are handled objectively, confidentially, and without retaliation. Outcomes are used constructively to improve quality.
Stage 1: Informal Resolution
Whenever possible, complaints should be raised directly with the relevant individual or department (e.g., lecturer or admin staff). If resolved at this level, the case is closed with no further action.
Stage 2: Formal Complaint
If informal resolution fails, a formal complaint must be submitted within 15 working days of the incident. The complainant should provide their contact details, a clear description of the issue, prior steps taken to resolve it, and the desired outcome. Complaints should be submitted via email to: [TBC].
Investigation and Outcome
The Quality Assurance Team will acknowledge receipt within 3 working days and appoint an impartial investigator or committee. The investigation will involve gathering relevant evidence and will conclude within 15 working days. A written outcome will be issued, detailing findings, actions taken, and any recommendations.
Stage 3: Appeal
If unsatisfied with the outcome, the complainant may submit a written appeal within 5 working days. A senior manager not previously involved will review the case and provide a final response within 10 working days.
Recording and Monitoring
All complaints and resolutions are recorded in the Complaints Register and reviewed quarterly by the Quality Assurance Board to identify recurring issues and drive improvement.
Review
This policy is reviewed annually to maintain alignment with national standards and institutional needs.
