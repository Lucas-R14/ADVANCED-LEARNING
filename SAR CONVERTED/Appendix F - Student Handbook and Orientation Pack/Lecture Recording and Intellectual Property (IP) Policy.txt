Lecture Recording and Intellectual Property (IP) Policy
Version 1.0 | Date: March 2025
Applies to: All Students, Academic Staff, and Guest Lecturers at Advanced Learning
Purpose and Scope
This policy outlines the use, storage, and sharing of lecture recordings at Advanced Learning, along with the rights and responsibilities related to intellectual property (IP). It applies to all audio, video, or screen captures of lectures, tutorials, and webinars, whether in-person or online, and to all participants including academic staff, guest lecturers, and students.
Key Principles
Recordings are used to enhance educational access and inclusion while respecting participants’ rights to privacy and data protection. IP ownership is clearly defined to prevent misuse or unauthorised distribution of recorded content.
Recording Conditions and Consent
Recordings may be made to support students unable to attend, accommodate learning needs, or assist internal quality assurance. Participants must be notified in advance, and tutors are required to announce recordings at the start of each session. Guest speakers must sign a consent form. Recordings may include the presenter’s audio/video, slides, and verbal student input (unless anonymised). Private conversations or chats should not be recorded without consent.
Access and Storage
Recordings are securely stored on the institution’s LMS and made available only to enrolled students and authorised staff. They are retained for up to one academic year unless longer storage is legally required. Downloading or sharing recordings without permission is prohibited.
Intellectual Property Ownership
Materials and recordings created by staff are owned by Advanced Learning, unless agreed otherwise. Guest lecturers retain ownership of their contributions but grant a limited licence for institutional use. Student work remains the student’s property; however, written consent is required if it is included in recorded or teaching materials.
Prohibited Use and Breaches
Recordings may not be altered, distributed, or published without explicit authorisation. Any unauthorised use will be treated as a serious violation and may result in disciplinary action, access restrictions, or legal proceedings. Breaches are reviewed by the Academic Board.
Review
This policy is reviewed annually or in response to changes in technology or regulation.
